# ICBAWeb
A Web application making tracking irrigation needs and planning easier

Some description about the project :

Designing a water crop requirement application ( ot be implemented on the web, as well as ios and android) using FAO 56 methods as well as SEBAL to identify through weather data the effective water needs of the plants based on the crop type, soil (region on the map) and cycle of growth.

## The Following Webite, and all the extensions of this work are made to satisfy three different clusters of users

  * Workers that wants to track the daily needs of water their crops need in an easy way
  * Decision makers who would like to have some insight on the future demands presented on a dashboard
  * Scientists who could use a tracker to keep count of the weather and cyclical changes in demands for water

We keep an eye as well on the aesthetic side and want to honor ICBA's color palette and visual identity through our design choices.
